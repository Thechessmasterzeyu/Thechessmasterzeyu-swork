üè´ **Grade:** Sixth Grade

üñ•Ô∏è **Chess

I started chess when I was in P3, and I slowly gained interest in it, and I even joined the International chess CCA! Now , I take part in competitions such as the international primary school chess competition, and I challenge the chess whiz at level 5 of my HDB! (I lose 99.99% of the time tho) :(   
I also had chess lessons with a master at chess, and I also like several GM's (Grandmasters) skills.
