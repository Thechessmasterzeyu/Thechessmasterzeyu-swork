## About Thechessmasterzeyu
👩‍🏫 **Name:** Thechessmasterzeyu

🏫 **Grade:** Sixth Grade

🖥️ **Chess

I started chess when I was in P3, and I slowly gained interest in it, and I even joined the International chess CCA! Now , I take part in competitions such as the international primary school chess competition, and I challenge the chess whiz at level 5 of my HDB! (I lose 99.99% of the time tho) :(   
I also had chess lessons with a master at chess, and I also like several GM's (Grandmasters) skills.


1. Garry Kasparov. 

Garry Kimovich Kasparov is a Russian chess grandmaster, former World Chess Champion, political activist and writer.  (Who would have known!)

2. Magnus Carlson.

Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster. He is a five-time World Chess Champion, the reigning four-time World Rapid Chess Champion, the reigning six-time World Blitz Chess Champion, and the reigning Chess World Cup Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011!

3. Ding Liren.

Ding Liren is a Chinese chess grandmaster and the reigning World Chess Champion. He is the highest-rated Chinese chess player in history and also a three-time Chinese Chess Champion.



The reasons I are their fans is because they are famous for saccing the queen (queen sacrifice), unlike other grandmasters like Hikaru Nakumara.
